A Prometheus exporter for certificates focusing on expiration monitoring, written in Go. Designed to monitor Kubernetes clusters from inside, it can also be used as a standalone exporter.

Get notified before they expire:

- PEM encoded files, by path or scanning directories
- Kubeconfigs with embedded certificates or file references
- TLS Secrets from a Kubernetes cluster

## Installation

### 🏃 TL; DR

The [Helm chart](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter/tree/master/deploy/charts/x509-certificate-exporter#-tldr) is the most straightforward way to get a fully-featured exporter running on your cluster.
The chart is also highly-customizable if you wish to. See the [chart documentation](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter/tree/master/deploy/charts/x509-certificate-exporter) to learn more.

The provided [Grafana Dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/13922) can also be used to display the exporter's metrics on your Grafana instance.

### Using Docker

A docker image is available at [enix/x509-certificate-exporter](https://hub.docker.com/r/enix/x509-certificate-exporter).

### Using the pre-built binaries

Every [release](https://github.com/enix/x509-certificate-exporter/releases) comes with pre-built binaries for many supported platforms.

### Using the source

The project's entry point is `./cmd/x509-certificate-exporter`.
You can run & build it as any other Go program:

```bash
go build ./cmd/x509-certificate-exporter
```

## Usage

The following metrics are available:

- `x509_cert_not_before`
- `x509_cert_not_after`
- `x509_cert_expired`
- `x509_cert_expires_in_seconds` (optional)
- `x509_cert_valid_since_seconds` (optional)
- `x509_cert_error` (optional)
- `x509_read_errors`
- `x509_exporter_build_info`

### Prometheus Alerts

When installation is not performed with Helm, the following Prometheus alerting
rules may be deployed manually:

```
rules:
    - alert: X509ExporterReadErrors
        annotations:
            description: Over the last 15 minutes, this x509-certificate-exporter instance
                has experienced errors reading certificate files or querying the Kubernetes
                API. This could be caused by a misconfiguration if triggered when the exporter
                starts.
            summary: Increasing read errors for x509-certificate-exporter
        expr: delta(x509_read_errors[15m]) > 0
        for: 5m
        labels:
            severity: warning
    - alert: CertificateRenewal
        annotations:
            description: Certificate for "{{ $labels.subject_CN }}" should be renewed
                {{if $labels.secret_name }}in Kubernetes secret "{{ $labels.secret_namespace
                }}/{{ $labels.secret_name }}"{{else}}at location "{{ $labels.filepath }}"{{end}}
            summary: Certificate should be renewed
        expr: ((x509_cert_not_after - time()) / 86400) < 28
        for: 15m
        labels:
            severity: warning
    - alert: CertificateExpiration
        annotations:
            description: Certificate for "{{ $labels.subject_CN }}" is about to expire
                {{if $labels.secret_name }}in Kubernetes secret "{{ $labels.secret_namespace
                }}/{{ $labels.secret_name }}"{{else}}at location "{{ $labels.filepath }}"{{end}}
            summary: Certificate is about to expire
        expr: ((x509_cert_not_after - time()) / 86400) < 14
        for: 15m
        labels:
            severity: critical
```

## Development

Some snippets to get started with development and testing:

```sh
# Run server, watch test input files, only listen on localhost to
# avoid firewall popup dialogs
go run ./cmd/x509-certificate-exporter --debug -b localhost:9793 -d test/

# Once the server is running, you can check the exported metrics
curl -Ss localhost:9793/metrics | grep "^x509_cert_not_after"

# Automated tests work against a Kubernetes cluster, so create a throwaway
# cluster (for example with kind). Do not run the server locally because the
# tests run the server executable with the default listening port.
kind create cluster --kubeconfig ~/.kube/config-kind
export KUBECONFIG=~/.kube/config-kind
go test -v ./internal
kind delete cluster

# Docker build (does not run tests)
docker buildx build .
```

## FAQ

### Why are you using the `not after` timestamp rather than a remaining number of seconds?

For two reasons.

First, Prometheus tends to do better storage consumption when a value stays identical over checks.

Then, it is better to compute the remaining time through a prometheus query as some latency (seconds) can exist
between this exporter check and your alert or query being run.

Here is an example:

```
x509_cert_not_after - time()
```

When collecting metrics from tools like Datadog that does not have timestamp functions,
the exporter can be run with the `--expose-relative-metrics` flag in order to add the following optional metrics:

- `x509_cert_valid_since_seconds`
- `x509_cert_expires_in_seconds`

### How to ensure it keeps working over time?

Changes in paths or deleted files may silently break the ability to watch critical certificates.

Because it's never convenient to alert on disapearing metrics, the exporter will publish on `x509_read_errors` how many
paths could not be read. It will also count Kubernetes API responses failures, but won't count deleted secrets.

A basic alert would be:

```
x509_read_errors > 0
```
