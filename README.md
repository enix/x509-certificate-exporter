A Prometheus exporter for X.509 certificates, built **for Kubernetes first**.
It watches your cluster's TLS material as native Kubernetes resources —
Secrets, ConfigMaps, kubeconfigs, on-disk PKI on the nodes — and turns
expirations into actionable Prometheus series. Designed to run inside the
cluster it observes, but equally happy as a standalone binary.

---

## ✨ What's new in v4

- **Full rewrite** around a YAML config file and a pluggable architecture — clean foundations for the project to grow on.
- **Memory-safe Kubernetes watch** — RAM stays flat instead of spiking; on Secret-heavy clusters, memory limits drop ~10×.
- **Richer PKCS#12 wiring** — full keystore + truststore coverage, flexible passphrase sourcing.
- **DER consumption** — raw cert / CRL blobs as served by HTTP CRL Distribution Points are now first-class inputs.
- **JKS / JCEKS support** — Java KeyStore and JCEKS stores.
- **CRL freshness monitoring** — Certificate Revocation Lists are tracked alongside certs, with alerts before they go stale.
- **Surface workload metadata** — lift watched resource labels onto emitted certificate series.
- **Supply-chain hardened** — SLSA Build L3 provenance, cosign-signed binaries, images and chart, SBOM attestations.
- **Multi-cluster from a single instance** — fan-in metrics from any number of clusters via distinct kubeconfigs.
- **Per-source observability** — granular health and triage signals, not just a global error counter.

## 🔍️ What it watches

- **TLS Secrets** of any type — `kubernetes.io/tls`, Opaque bundles,
  full chains — across all namespaces or a curated subset.
- **ConfigMaps** holding cert or CRL data under any key you point at.
- **PKCS#12** keystores and truststores, with passphrase pulled from a
  sibling key in the same Secret, an external file, a cross-namespace
  Secret reference, or none (`tryEmptyPassphrase`).
- **JKS / JCEKS** keystores and truststores — magic-byte auto-detection
  between JKS and JCEKS; passphrase from a sibling key, external file,
  or `tryEmptyPassphrase`.
- **Certificate Revocation Lists** — `X509 CRL` PEM blocks (intermixed
  freely with `CERTIFICATE` blocks) and raw DER `*.crl` files
  (`format: der`) are parsed into the dedicated `x509_crl_*` family so
  a stale CRL pages on-call before its consumers start rejecting the
  issuer's certs.
- **Admission and API-discovery caBundles** — inline `caBundle` PEM
  fields on cluster-scoped admission resources
  (`MutatingWebhookConfiguration`, `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`),
  the API-aggregation layer (`APIService`), and CRDs with a
  conversion webhook (`CustomResourceDefinition`).
- **PEM chains** — every certificate in a multi-cert bundle becomes its own
  series, so intermediate CAs and trust roots appear alongside leaf certs
  with no extra configuration.
- **Kubeconfigs** with embedded base64 certificates or PEM file references —
  every `cluster` and `user` block exposed as its own series.
- **Files on disk** — glob patterns (`*`, `**`, `?`), atomic symlink swaps
  detected on the next poll (certbot renewals, kubelet projected `..data/`
  mounts), and dual deployment: inside the exporter pod **or** as a
  node-local DaemonSet for cluster PKI (kubelet, etcd, kube-apiserver).

> [!WARNING]
> **Upgrading from version 3?** Start with the

> moved to OCI on `quay.io`, the Alpine image variant is retired, and a few
> values keys changed shape.

## ⚙️ Under the hood

- **100% Go.** A few thousand lines, no CGO, no plugins — auditable end
  to end in an afternoon.

- **Performance-aware.** Parsed certificates are cached so repeat scrapes
  don't re-decode the same PEM blocks. On Kubernetes, the exporter pages
  through Secrets and ConfigMaps with a paginated **LIST + WATCH** loop
  (50 objects per page by default) instead of polling `kube-apiserver`,
  with watch traffic that scales with churn, not with scrape rate.

- **Helm-first delivery.** A first-party [Helm chart](./chart) covers
  Deployments, DaemonSets, RBAC, ServiceMonitor, PrometheusRule, and a
  Grafana dashboard. Published as an OCI artifact.

- **Cross-platform binaries.** Each release ships statically-linked
  binaries for Linux, macOS, Windows, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, Illumos
  and Solaris across `amd64`, `arm64`, `armv7` and `riscv64`. Drop one on
  a legacy box, run it under systemd or Windows Services — the exporter
  has no daemon dependencies and reads files straight from disk.

- **Plays with any Prometheus-compatible collector.** The `/metrics`
  endpoint speaks the canonical OpenMetrics text format and supports
  TLS + BasicAuth via `prometheus/exporter-toolkit` (`--web.config.file`),
  so **mTLS** scrapes work out of the box. Tested against / known to
  work with: Prometheus, Grafana Agent / Alloy, VictoriaMetrics (`vmagent`),
  Thanos, Cortex / Grafana Mimir, OpenTelemetry Collector, Datadog Agent,
  Elastic Metricbeat, Splunk OTel Collector, Sysdig, New Relic, Dynatrace,
  Sumo Logic, Wavefront, Telegraf.

- **Open, signed, attested supply chain.** Every release is built by a
  single open-source GitHub Actions
  [pipeline](.github/workflows/release.yaml). Container images, Helm
  chart, and binaries are signed with **sigstore/cosign** keyless (no
  maintainer-held private key); binaries carry a **SLSA Level 3** in-toto
  provenance attestation; images carry a CycloneDX SBOM as a cosign
  attestation. Verification recipes live in the
  [hardening guide](./docs/hardening.md).

- **Defensive by intent.** The project tracks the
  [OpenSSF Scorecard][ossf] and converges on its recommendations —
  pinned dependencies, branch protection, signed commits, dependency
  review, SBOM, no force-pushes. Finding a defensive practice we don't
  follow yet? Open an issue.

## 🔁 How it fits in your DevOps loop

End-to-end, the exporter is one piece in a four-stage pipeline that you
likely already run for every other workload. No new tooling to learn, no
parallel control plane — just one more metric family in the observability
stack you already have.

1. **Deploy.** A single `helm install` drops a Deployment (in-cluster
   Secrets / ConfigMaps) and, optionally, DaemonSets (on-node PKI like
   kubelet, etcd, kube-apiserver). No CRDs of its own, no operator.
   Outside Kubernetes, the same binary runs as a systemd unit pointed at
   files on disk.

2. **Scrape.** The chart creates a `ServiceMonitor` (or `PodMonitor`) so
   a [prometheus-operator][po]-managed Prometheus picks the exporter up
   automatically. On clusters without the operator, the standard
   `prometheus.io/scrape` Pod annotations work just as well.

3. **Alert.** A `PrometheusRule` ships with six batteries-included
   alerts: read-errors canary (RBAC / parsing / missing files),
   per-certificate error, renewal warning (28 days out by default),
   expiration critical (14 days out), plus the two CRL-freshness rules
   `CRLNeedsRefresh` (7 days before `nextUpdate`) and `CRLStale`
   (the moment `nextUpdate` is crossed). Alertmanager routes them like
   any other rule — Slack, PagerDuty, email, webhooks — and the
   thresholds plus individual alerts are tunable per install.

4. **Visualize.** A ready-to-import [Grafana dashboard][dash] lists every
   certificate the exporter sees, sorted by time remaining, sliced by
   namespace, source, and issuer. Deploy it via the chart as a
   sidecar-discovered ConfigMap (`grafana.createDashboard: true`) or
   import the JSON by hand.

The net effect: a certificate renewal is no longer an outage waiting to
happen. The on-call rotation that already triages your service alerts
also catches expiring certs — 28 days ahead for the leaf, 14 for the
critical ones — and the team that owns the workload owns the renewal,
instead of a platform team scrambling the day a `cert-manager` annotation
turns out to have been misspelled six months ago.
